The Web App Cross-Region Resiliency pattern deploys a 3-tier web application on VPC Virtual Servers using compute, storage, and network cloud resources as well as other Cloud Services provisioned in multiple availability zones across two regions to protect from region-wide natural disasters or outages.

This pattern is recommended to address out-of-region disaster recovery policies or business continuity policies with geo or distance compliance requirements. It supports recovery point objective (RPO)\<=15 mins and recovery time objective (RTO)\<=1 hour requirements.

\*The Architecture Framework provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a set of "aspects" and "domains", which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. See [Introduction to the Architecture Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro) for more details.

## Architecture overview
{: #architecture-overview}

-   The Web, Application, and Database tiers are deployed on VPC Virtual Server Instances (VSIs). Cloud Object Storage (COS) is used to store static web content. High performance VPC block storage (10 IOPS/GB) is used for the database tier.

-   The virtual servers in the Web and App tiers are placed within [Placement Groups](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-placement-groups-for-vpc&interface=ui) for host failure protection and are part of [Instance Groups](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-group&interface=ui) for autoscaling. A VPC Application Load Balancer (ALB) is used at the web and app tiers tier to route traffic to healthy application instances.

-   The Web, Application, and Database tiers are deployed within the Workload Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Management tools, such as backup tools, are deployed in the Management VPC. A local Transit Gateway allows traffic between the management and workload VPCs.

-   Virtual servers for each tier are placed in separate subnets within each availability zone. Security groups and ACLs are used as firewalls to limit access to virtual server instances for operational purposes and control network traffic to each web app tier.

-   The Cloud Internet Service is deployed as a proxy to the public VPC Application Load Balancer that front ends the web tier to provide Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection and Web Application Firewall protection to the web servers exposed to the internet.

-   The Web Application is deployed across two regions using an active-standby approach to enable failover in the event of an outage of the primary region. A Global Transit Gateway connects VPCs across the two regions.

-   The Web and App tiers are deployed across two availability zones in the primary region and the DR region.

-   The Database tier is deployed in active-standby across two availability zones in the primary region with another standby replica in one availability zone in the DR region. Data replication is handled by the database software based on HA/DR configuration settings.

-   The Cloud Internet Service is configured as a Global Load Balancer to route traffic to the appropriate region.

-   All data is encrypted using customer-provided keys managed by Key Protect. All storage is encrypted at rest using storage encryption with customer-provided keys managed by Key Protect. Key Protect is provisioned in the primary region and configured with failover units in the second region.

-   Data is encrypted in transit using TLS encryption. A Secrets Manager instance is deployed in each region to store and manage SSL/TLS certificates.

-   IBM Storage Protect is used to create database backups to enable data recovery.

-   IBM Monitoring, IBM Logging, and Activity Tracker instances are deployed in each region. IBM Monitoring is used to check the health of the servers and storage as well as the health of the web application. IBM Logging is used to get logs from the servers, storage, and web application. Monitoring and Logging data is stored in Cloud Object Storage based on the selected retention period. Activity Tracker stores audit logs in Cloud Object Storage. Logs stored in COS are encrypted at rest using COS encryption with customer-provided keys.

-   A VPC VPN Client in the Management VPC in each region provides operational access to resources within the IBM Cloud private network.

-   A bastion host in the Management VPC in each region is used to provide remote access to the infrastructure and application for management purposes and to record all access and opertions performed by remote users for audit purposes.
