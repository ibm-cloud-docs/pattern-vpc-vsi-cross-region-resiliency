<!-- Note to author>    THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT 10 – 15 LINES AND FOLLOW….
The objective of this pattern is to provide a solution design for……. -->

This pattern provides a solution design for a 3-tier web architecture deployment on [IBM Cloud VPC Virtual Servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started&interface=ui) that meets disaster recovery requirements for enterprise workloads. It is intended to:

- Accelerate and simplify solution design by providing a standard IBM Cloud deployment architecture reference following the [IBM Architecture Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework).

- Provide a prescriptive, end-2-end enterprise-class solution design, with diagrams, component architecture decisions along with rationale for cloud component selection to meet enterprise requirements.

- Ensure requirements can be met from a performance, system availability and security perspective.

This pattern leverages cloud platform capabilities to architect resilient applications on VPC Virtual Servers. It is not intended for applications deployed on Power Virtual Servers (PowerVS) and does not cover application or database high availability design.
